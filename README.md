👋 Hi, I’m @AbhishekAeera

👀 I’m interested in machine learning, AI applications, data analytics, and big data technologies — basically anything that turns raw data into smart decisions.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data science concepts at the University of Hertfordshire, including deep learning, data engineering, and predictive modeling.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative data-driven projects, research in AI, or anything involving data wrangling and intelligent systems.

📫 How to reach me: abhishekarra70@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I once told my dataset a joke... but it still refused to split!
